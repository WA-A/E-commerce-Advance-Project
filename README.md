# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- ## 
T-Shop is a site that allows the user to create an account and access his profile using Validate and prevent him from entering any page without logging in. He can modify his data, such as the password, 
by sending a code to his email, 
and he can obtain a new password from Forgot Password.
Through the Categories pages, the user can view the various Categories, 
and each Categories user can access the products page, view its details and pictures,
and through the product number, he can add it to the cart or delete it, 
and the number of products in the cart appears and he can place an order.
